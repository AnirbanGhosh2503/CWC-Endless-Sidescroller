## 🎮 Game Overview

In **Prototype 3**, players control a 3D character that automatically runs across the screen while the environment scrolls.  
The player must **jump over obstacles**, land safely, and avoid hazards.

🔹 **Auto-run + Jump**  
🔹 **Gravity-based physics**  
🔹 **Obstacle detection & destruction**  
🔹 **Animation control via state machines**
